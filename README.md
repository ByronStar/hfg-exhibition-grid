## Workflow
Throughout this document we will mention two user groups:
1. **Editor**: The person that organizes the kiosk, collects the content folders from the student and sets up the site.
2. **Student**: The persons which have built the projects

If you're the **Editor**, proceed to *Installation*. If you're a **Student**, proceed to *Creating a Content Folder*

## Installation

## Creating a Content Folder

Download the folder and populate it as following:
